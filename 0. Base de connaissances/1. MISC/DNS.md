| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
