# WPS Connection Methods

There are four methods to connect to a WPS-enabled access point. Each of them is detailed below:

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|`Push Button Configuration (PBC)`|This is the most common method and involves pressing a physical or virtual button on the router and the client device. Once the button is pressed on both devices, they automatically exchange the necessary information to establish a secure connection.|
|`PIN Entry`|Each WPS-enabled device has an 8-digit PIN code, either provided by the manufacturer or displayed on the device. Users enter this PIN on their router or access point’s configuration page to connect the device to the network.|
|`Near-field communication method`|Some devices support NFC, allowing users to tap the device on the router to establish a connection. This method is less common but offers an additional level of convenience.|
|`USB Flash Drive`|Involves transferring configuration settings via a USB drive from the router to the client device. This method is rarely used due to the inconvenience compared to other methods.|

Utilise EAP ( [Extensible Authentication Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol)) comme le WPA

Seulement 11000 combinaisons (10^4 + 10^3) possible. Le dernier digit est un checksum facile à calculer.
