To mitigate the `Security Misconfiguration` vulnerability, the `/api/v1/products/{Name}/count` endpoint should utilize parameterized queries or an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) (`ORM`) to safely insert user-controlled values into SQL queries. If that is not a choice, it must validate user-controlled input before concatenating it into the SQL query, which is never infallible.
