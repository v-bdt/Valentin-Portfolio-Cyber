To mitigate the `BFLA` vulnerability, the `/api/v1/products/discounts` endpoint should enforce an authorization check at the source-code level to ensure that only users with the `ProductDiscounts_GetAll` role can interact with it. This involves verifying the user's roles before processing the request, ensuring that unauthorized users are denied access to the endpoint's functionality.
