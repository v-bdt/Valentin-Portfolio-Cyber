To mitigate the `Excessive Data Exposure` vulnerability, the `/api/v1/suppliers` endpoint should only return fields necessary from the customers' perspective. This can be achieved by returning a specific response [Data Transfer Object (DTO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) that includes only the fields intended for customer visibility, rather than exposing the entire domain model used for database interaction.
