#### Instruction Cycle

The instruction set describes the totality of the machine instructions of a processor. The scope of the instruction set varies considerably depending on the processor type. Each CPU may have different instruction cycles and instruction sets, but they are all similar in structure, which we can summarize as follows:

|**Instruction**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1. FETCH`|The next machine instruction address is read from the `Instruction Address Register` (`IAR`). It is then loaded from the `Cache` or `RAM` into the `Instruction Register` (`IR`).|
|`2. DECODE`|The instruction decoder converts the instructions and starts the necessary circuits to execute the instruction.|
|`3. FETCH OPERANDS`|If further data have to be loaded for execution, these are loaded from the cache or `RAM` into the working registers.|
|`4. EXECUTE`|The instruction is executed. This can be, for example, operations in the `ALU`, a jump in the program, the writing back of results into the working registers, or the control of peripheral devices. Depending on the result of some instructions, the status register is set, which can be evaluated by subsequent instructions.|
|`5. UPDATE INSTRUCTION POINTER`|If no jump instruction has been executed in the EXECUTE phase, the `IAR` is now increased by the length of the instruction so that it points to the next machine instruction.|
