## Source

|**Information Source**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Code`|This means that the already executed program code results are used as a source of information. These can come from different functions of a program.|
|`Libraries`|A library is a collection of program resources, including configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, prebuilt code and subroutines, classes, values, or type specifications.|
|`Config`|Configurations are usually static or prescribed values that determine how the process processes information.|
|`APIs`|The application programming interface (API) is mainly used as the interface of programs for retrieving or providing information.|
|`User Input`|If a program has a function that allows the user to enter specific values used to process the information accordingly, this is the manual entry of information by a person.|
## Processes

|**Process Components**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PID`|The Process-ID (PID) identifies the process being started or is already running. Running processes have already assigned privileges, and new ones are started accordingly.|
|`Input`|This refers to the input of information that could be assigned by a user or as a result of a programmed function.|
|`Data processing`|The hard-coded functions of a program dictate how the information received is processed.|
|`Variables`|The variables are used as placeholders for information that different functions can further process during the task.|
|`Logging`|During logging, certain events are documented and, in most cases, stored in a register or a file. This means that certain information remains in the system.|
## Privileges

| **Privileges** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `System`       | These privileges are the highest privileges that can be obtained, which allow any system modification. In Windows, this type of privilege is called `SYSTEM`, and in Linux, it is called `root`.          |
| `User`         | User privileges are permissions that have been assigned to a specific user. For security reasons, separate users are often set up for particular services during the installation of Linux distributions. |
| `Groups`       | Groups are a categorization of at least one user who has certain permissions to perform specific actions.                                                                                                 |
| `Policies`     | Policies determine the execution of application-specific commands, which can also apply to individual or grouped users and their actions.                                                                 |
| `Rules`        | Rules are the permissions to perform actions handled from within the applications themselves.                                                                                                             |

## Destination

|**Destination**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Local`|The local area is the system's environment in which the process occurred. Therefore, the results and outcomes of a task are either processed further by a process that includes changes to data sets or storage of the data.|
|`Network`|The network area is mainly a matter of forwarding the results of a process to a remote interface. This can be an IP address and its services or even entire networks. The results of such processes can also influence the route under certain circumstances.|



## Exemple avec Log4j

#### Initiation of the Attack

|**Step**|**Log4j**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`1.`|The attacker manipulates the user agent with a JNDI lookup command.|`Source`|
|`2.`|The process misinterprets the assigned user agent, leading to the execution of the command.|`Process`|
|`3.`|The JNDI lookup command is executed with administrator privileges due to logging permissions.|`Privileges`|
|`4.`|This JNDI lookup command points to the server created and prepared by the attacker, which contains a malicious Java class containing commands designed by the attacker.|`Destination`|

This is when the cycle starts all over again, but this time to gain remote access to the target system.

#### Trigger Remote Code Execution

|**Step**|**Log4j**|**Concept of Attacks - Category**|
|---|---|---|
|`5.`|After the malicious Java class is retrieved from the attacker's server, it is used as a source for further actions in the following process.|`Source`|
|`6.`|Next, the malicious code of the Java class is read in, which in many cases has led to remote access to the system.|`Process`|
|`7.`|The malicious code is executed with administrator privileges due to logging permissions.|`Privileges`|
|`8.`|The code leads back over the network to the attacker with the functions that allow the attacker to control the system remotely.|`Destination`|
